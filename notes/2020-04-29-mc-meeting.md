    - Immersive experience designer, digital media
    - How people go through and experience, VR, immersive performances
    - Also live entertainment production (incl. lighting, sound) and incorporating those
    - Columbia Digital Storytelling Lab
    - Interactive media: Gaming, video
    - Take Sherlock Holmes:
        - Typically have a "guide"/ or character to provide instruction/move the story forward
    - Geocache podcast
        - GPS location and story in digital lantern 
- dc: thinking about how people inhabit multiple spaces
    - https://github.com/ournetworks/2020/issues/20
- Michael: 
    - Early netart examples: Linked/nested pages with trail of breadcrumbs 
    - Marketing/branding: http://42entertainment.com/
        - Dark Knight: https://www.42entertainment.com/work/whysoserious
    - dc: What is this called? AR space?
        - Theatre / ARG / VR
    - Friend's project, Pandemic: https://vimeo.com/26740259 
        - Situation Room
        - "Signed up for it"
        - Online Attendees
        - People Globally
- dc "open up imagination but bring it back"
- dc: We are volunteer / limited budget (< $20,000CAD)
- dc: Opt-in, maybe a physical component in a registration package
    - M: could be a hook to draw people in, something around agency 
    - dc: I think we're pretty pluralist -- don't want to be opinionated about a narrow vision. Instead pluralistic
    - Mauve: libertarian <--> lefty range of political views
        - empower communities more the ournets side of things
        - social rather than tech side (or social in service of tech)
- M: Like the idea of plurality of ideas around connection
    - Great area to explore, could be the bedrock of the experience "Connection mean to use as an individual, how does decentralization empower you to create the connections you want"
- M: audience member?
    -  artists, researchers, designers, technologists
    -  in-person: major chunk not from the space, including folks new to tech
    -  into family-friendly
    -  into other languages!
-  M: Could create a supplemental experience, but would recommend it kept tightly to the our networks event (online folks who leave and are gone)
    -  frame it as supplemental
    -  there might be completionists, people curious about other people
- July 1 too radical?
    - 60 days is AMBITIOUS!
    - tailored small experience
    - might need heavier hand on guidance versus a sandbox
- Would be interested in collaborating!
    - preproduction + brainstorming sessions?

## TODOs

- dc -- will bring it back orga, confirm we have capacity then follow up end of this week! May 1
- Have another call to cutline the event expectations and get to core, explore what attendees would feel/takeaway -- brainstorming sesh!

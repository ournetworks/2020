# Our Networks AV Stuff

## Talk about AV requirements for Our Networks

- Talk about event schedule
- Format of talks
    - Approved?
    - Format?
    - Expectations on tech reqs
    - How to get video
    - Pre-recorded?
    - Live?
- Live streaming the event
- Distributing recordings over IPFS / Dat (now hypercore protocol)?

## To figure out

- BBV Workshop and conferenc streams at same time?
    - BBB has some form of [RTMP streaming](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/8295)
- What's the concurrency?
- Easier to have one stream
- Q&A?
- Might be able to do our own streaming (Elon's system)?
- Have a Youtube channel already, good for discovery.
- Youtube doesn't run ads unless you tell them to. (confirmed)
- Twitch runs ads if you're an affiliate, not lower end streamers (probably?)
- Should we record live and stream at different times for international audiences?
- Matrix chat on the website for chat? BBB?
- Maybe BBB streamed talks doesn't have audience in the call
- Have workshops jut use their BBB rooms for chat
- Post Processing? Whatever last year?
- How to get the different sources from BBB?

## Summary proposal

- Youtube streaming / Also stream to Elon's servers
- Could rebroadcst later (discuss)
- Use Matrix for stream Q/A chat + Live Stream on website
- Have main talk track that's streamed / recorded from BBB with just speakers
- Maybe talk about Hypercore for live streams? Probaly not.
- Double check if talks/workshops are simultanious
- Figure out if we can get the individual sources out of BBB.
- Figure out if we can get speakers decent mics if they have bad ones
    - This is a big one! -Hank

## Feedback from Ben 

> I think if you can tell us what you need, e.g. # of rooms, parallel rooms, duration, expected ppl per room, etc. then we can quote you something to take back to ournets
> in that room, you have the option to buy from meet.coop / collocall (or neither of cos)
> it will depend on whether your needs, we can actually met in time
> also how you plan to maange permissions, etc

## Feedback from Orga

- Talks are single track
- Need to confirm streaming
- Mostly linear, might have talks at the same time as workshops
- Might have day without streams
- 4 days of streaming
- Everything is pretty similar
    - Talks on BBB - all of them
    - Workshops will tend to use different platforms
    - Some performances are a little different
    - Streamed exhibitions, can we have them on the main stream when nothing else is going on? They're on different platforms (one is twitch)
- Prerecorded video? Nah.
- Is it possible to delete livestream recordings on Youtube?
- Can we record without live streaming?
- Can we do live without recording?
- Recording / Streaming changes will be clustered
- Elon's servers are a nice to have, get YT working first and then them
- Moderation concerns with chat. Else Matrix or whatever is good.
- Can we turn off the public chat on BBB?
- Chat not attached to livestream?
- Have a test call with speakers
    - Divide people into slots and have them go in groups
    - Make sure they can all turn their cams and mics on
- Cant' afford to send mics to folks probably
- Zoom would cost us like 300, 500 would be absolute upper limit
    - Two rooms version would be cheaper
    - Should have it ready at least the week before (for testing). Maybe have it around August 31 or Sept 1.
    - Something about paying for a month? Is that still a thing.
- Will need to livestream prerecorded video, for some artworks
- Need to confirm if one of the performances (from jitsi) will need to be streamed

## Meeting with Ben about BBB

- Recordings still made even when you say not to, the pieces will expire
- Video separated for video and slides

## Feedback on proposal

- It's 8-12, can that make the price go down? Is it possible to negotiate down to 15 days from 1 month?
- Option 2 looks good, dedicated server
- Clarify what the support is, will we have somebody available for the times we're scheduling?
- Any flexability in support?

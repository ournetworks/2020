  - Aug Week 4

  - July Week 1

## Funding/budget expectations

- Decision to revisit applying for TAC (Mar 02), OAC (April 30)
  - todo: co-work at upcoming session on grant
- Research on CAC Digital Strategy Fund (rolling deadline)

## Organization structure

- We are within exemption limit given budget, not in place where need to do HST etc...
- Last year flagged question of org structure b/c it can limit liability, open funding channels, might be required by budget 
- Discussion that we'll be inline with last 2 years budget: ~$16,000 
- Informal structure working, we have banking set up. 
- Decision to sit on formalizing structure if main benefit would be around insurance 

## Capacity, Organizer?

- Areas: Exhibition, Social media, Website, Design, Vision/CFP, Mesh(?), Social, Swag, Sponsorship, Livestream
- Concern with Ben gone we've lost a lot of capacity around livestream (and ties to mesh communities)
- Could see 1-2 other organizers joining team to ensure we have capacity.
- Decision: invite two folks, looking for one with avail mostly in Toronto. Hopefully they could attend our next call!

## Colours?! Look and Feel

- Parked, but had some brainstorming at the end!

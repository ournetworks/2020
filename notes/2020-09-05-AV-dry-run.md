- "Always recording" in cache files
- Why OBS versus BBB cache?
    - not source files
    - hank: wants for post-production

- 1 BBB room "mainstage", dumping cache/ending meeting at END OF BLOCK
- 1 BBB room "off-the-record", non-recorded
- 1 BBB room PER workshop
    - could workshops on Mozilla Hubs

- Presenters
    - Always recorded in "mainstages"
    - Any audio and video in presentation needs to be shared to A/V team in advance (av@ournetworks.ca) -- slides and static content no issue, but feel free to share a backup of your deck to slides@

### Moderatable Spaces

- BBB per workshop
- Matrix chat

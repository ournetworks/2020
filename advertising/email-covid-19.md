Subject: Strengthening our networks in uncertain times

Hi all,

We'll keep this brief, as we expect you are getting many emails and notifications related to COVID-19 just as we are as organizers. 

We anticipated our next email to contain an announcement of our theme and the release of our CFP. However, as the COVID-19 situation has rapidly evolved we feel it is likely that the direct impact of the pandemic as well as disruptions and aftershocks will continue for months. 

That said, we're plotting a course for Our Networks 2020 to continue and have added a brief statement to the website [https://ournetworks.ca/]. As we proceed we also want to hear your thoughts, concerns, and hopes for how we can strengthen our networks in uncertain times and appropriately respond to the emerging moment we now collectively find ourselves in. 

So, please don't hesitate to get in touch: orga@ournetworks.ca 

We're also hosting a call if that format is better, all are welcome to attend this Thursday March 19, 4:00 pm EDT (1:00 pm PDT / 8:00 pm GMT / 9:00 pm CET): 
https://meet.jit.si/ournetworks.


Take care of yourselves and each other,
ðŸ–¤

PS - For those spending a lot more time at home, our 2019 videos were posted awhile ago alongside the previous year: https://ournetworks.ca/recorded-talks/

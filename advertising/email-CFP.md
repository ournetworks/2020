Call for Participation: Come meet us online for Our Networks 2020

This year we’re taking a different approach given the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation--

**Growing Our Networks in Uncertain Times/Places**
August 7-9, 2020 with virtual activations through the month of July 
https://ournetworks.ca/


We are moving beyond an in-person event, instead inviting you all to collectively invent the future of our networks in virtual spaces. In the presence of so many unknowns, how can alternative network infrastructures support the creation of radically equitable futures? What tactics of distributed collective care allow us to offer mutual aid in this moment? How can we apply more broadly what we learn as we go about decentralizing the conference across time and place?  

**This is a call to face the uncertainty together—come meet us online.** We’re looking for a range of virtual activations through the month of July leading up to and including the weekend of August 7–9! 

There will be room for familiar formats, including streamed talks and virtual workshops, but we are especially interested in activations that break free from the bounds of an “online conference.” For example, you could host a durational study group, run a meetup in a game world, exhibit an art project using a platform in some unexpected way, experiment with collective forms of distributed expression (à la Twitch Plays Pokémon). We are excited to draw on the possibilities for shared online experiences that a remote event affords. Leaning into new forms of interaction that build collective experiences at a distance, we can collectively cultivate virtual experiences that feel intimate, exploratory, and expansive.

The deadline for proposals is June 1, 2020. We highly encourage you to email us or attend an open hour if you have questions about formats and activations—we’re here to offer support.

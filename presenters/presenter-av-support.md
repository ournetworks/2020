Subject: Our Networks: A/V support, program, registration, and alternate reality game 

Dear Presenters,

We're excited for Our Networks next week and wanted to send an update email covering a few remaining topics -- 

## A/V and SESSION SUPPORT

For sessions we'll be using:

- BigBlueButton for talks and larger workshops/discussions
- Mozilla Hubs for smaller workshops 

Our A/V team will provide specific connection instructions to the room your session will be hosted in on Tuesday. Each room will have a moderator (and for streamed/recorded talks A/V support) for the duration of your session.

If you'd like to familiarize yourself with the platform we will be hosting a presenter session on Tuesday at 15:00 ET for testing mics and cameras, and familiarizing yourself with the BBB/Hubs interface and features. Links to follow on Tuesday!

In the meantime, and during the conference, any A/V support requests can go to A/V@ournetworks.ca

## FINAL-ISH PROGRAM

Our (almost?) final program is live on the website here: https://ournetworks.ca/program/#schedule
Thanks all for bearing with us as we accomodated session change requests.

We'll have a version of the program with call links open to registered attendees that goes live by Tuesday, September 8 in the morning.

## REGISTRATION (PACKAGE) -- OPTIONAL!

As presenters there is no cost to participate in Our Networks and in previous years we've managed registration for presenters. 

However this year we've prepared a physical registration package with some stickers and fun bits for the event. If you'd like to receive them we encourage you to register formally.

## ALTERNATE REALITY GAME

You may have seen a few sessions on our schedule for "Concious Networks" an Alternate Reality game (ARG) that is woven through the event, we have plans to have easter eggs in event spaces outside of those sessions but also wanted to extend the invitation to presenters who are interested--  

A package with information on aspects of the ARG as well as some assets is here: https://github.com/ournetworks/ARG/tree/master/sahara_package


if you have any questions or want to chat about ideas for integrating aspects, Michael Coney is leading the experience: mconeymusic@gmail.com or you can always email orga@ournetworks.ca


Finally, along with all attendees you'll recieve an email on Tuesday with program details.





Subject: Our Networks: Virtual load-in this weekend, program, registration, and alternate reality game 


Dear Exhibitors,

We're excited for Our Networks next week and wanted to send an update email covering a few remaining topics -- 

## VIRTUAL LOAD-IN

We're hoping to launch the "live" program by Tuesday September 8 in the morning, so are requesting exhibitors do a virtual load-in anytime from now until over the weekend.

If you could confirm the following when you get the chance:

- Final link for the program
- Any timing instructions to add to program
- A preferred cover image for social media

... that would be wonderful! As always, let us know if you have any questions.

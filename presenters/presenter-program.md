Hello presenters,

Just a quick update--we've got a draft program to share with another
email to follow this week on A/V details and registration.

✨ DRAFT PROGRAM

Based on peoples timezones and scheduling constraints we've developed a
draft program for our new dates in September:

Please take a moment to review your session time to ensure everything is
okay. We anticipate updating the website to showcase exhibited works,
session descriptions, and bios through this week, leading up to
registration launching.


If you notice any issues or changes need to be made, please reply to
this email or contact us at orga@ournetworks.ca


More soon!

Our first event, some Internet Aerobics to get us warmed up, starts at
11:00 ET [UTC-4], with workshops beginning at 11:30 ET.


A couple notes for the day, with original instructions at the bottom:

1. Signing up for Saturday workshops

✨🌱 SIGNING UP FOR SATURDAY WORKSHOPS

✨🌱🌿 CONSCIOUS NETWORKING WORKSHOP -- #AUXPLUG

You may have seen the news about Sahara and that we as conference
organizers have chosen to end our relationships with Sahara.

After speaking with the instructor however, the final Conscious Networks
workshop will go ahead today free from the philosophy of 'pervasive
networking' that sahara.digital was trying to instill.

Find it on the schedule at 14.00 ET [UTC-4]:

✨🌱🌴 CODE OF CONDUCT

Our Networks has a Code of Conduct in order to foster an environment
where we can all work together. We've further adapted it to account for
moderation needs in online spaces. We ask everyone to take time to
review it beforehand: https://ournetworks.ca/code-of-conduct/

We will have volunteers and organizers present in spaces we are able to
moderate, and clearly indicate on the program those spaces that only
have partial or no moderation.

During the event if you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
being harassed, or have any other concerns, we ask you to contact an
organizer or volunteer immediately. Those who wish to do so but don’t
feel comfortable talking to the organizers directly can email
coc@ournetworks.ca, which will be monitored during the event.



Let us know if you have questions about the code of conduct, online
spaces accessibility, or anything else: orga@ournetworks.ca


⚐ We're excited for you to meet us online!

✨🌱🌴 CODE OF CONDUCT

Our Networks has a Code of Conduct in order to foster an environment
where we can all work together. We've further adapted it to account for
moderation needs in online spaces. We ask everyone to take time to
review it beforehand: https://ournetworks.ca/code-of-conduct/

We will have volunteers and organizers present in spaces we are able to
moderate, and clearly indicate on the program those spaces that only
have partial or no moderation.

During the event if you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
being harassed, or have any other concerns, we ask you to contact an
organizer or volunteer immediately. Those who wish to do so but don’t
feel comfortable talking to the organizers directly can email
coc@ournetworks.ca, which will be monitored during the event.



Let us know if you have questions about the code of conduct, online
spaces accessibility, or anything else: orga@ournetworks.ca


⚐ We're excited for you to meet us online!

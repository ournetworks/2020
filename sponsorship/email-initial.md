Hello [ORG_CONTACT],

I'm a co-organizer for a community-driven event called Our Networks 
(https://ournetworks.ca/), and event focused on the past, present, and 
future of alternative networks, including the decentralized and peer-to-peer 
web.

Now in our fourth year, our theme for 2020 is Growing Our Networks in 
Uncertain Times/Places. Due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation 
we are moving beyond an in-person event, instead inviting participants to 
collectively invent the future of our networks in virtual spaces. 

We have an ambitious plan for a range of virtual activations through the 
month of July leading up to and including the weekend of August 7–9, 2020. 
We will include familiar formats like streamed talks and virtual workshops, 
but because of the technical interests and expertise of our audience we also 
expect activations that break free from the bounds of an “online conference.”

The shift to online has added considerations for budgeting and financial sustainability of the conference. We're operating with a smaller budget and still planning on charging registration--which will include a physical registration package--but as with similar virtual events anticipate a large portion of the program will be open to the public. 

As a result, we are asking mission and value-driven sponsors to support us at our "Tier 1 Network" level of $1500 or above. This would allow us to offer the widest access possible to attendees, while still covering A/V and livestream costs, honoraria for artists and presenters, and more. In the attached sponsorship package we've detailed how we would mark your support.

[Say something about fit between ORG and Our Networks]... speak directly
to the themes of the conference and I would love to speak with you about
sponsorship opportunities in the coming weeks, could we set up a call?

If this is a request that should be handled by someone else within
[ORG_NAME], I'd appreciate if you could put me in touch with the
correct person.


Many thanks,

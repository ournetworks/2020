Hello [SPONSOR_NAME],

Thank you for supporting Our Networks 2019 as a [Tier X] sponsor! I just wanted to follow up on next steps sponsorship but also we have some additional news: 


After careful deliberation, the organizing team has decided to postpone Our Networks 2020 a month. Our core conference days will now take place September 8-13, 2020.

This year has held a lot of surprises, and planning and event in the midst of COVID-19 has encompassed many of them. Despite managing some of the uncertainty by transitioning online, many aspects of the event have been slower to coalesce in 2020 than in years prior. Rather than push ahead with the original dates and a more rushed event, we've decided to slow down and take the time required to ensure we deliver the best version possible of our first fully-online conference.

We plan to launch registration next week and will provide information on RSVP codes for complimentary registrations at that time.

We used the previous assets [SPONSOR_NAME] has provided to add a logo to our website: https://ournetworks.ca/sponsors/
We will use the same logo for other branding. Can you let us know if there are any changes?

In addition, as a [Tier 1] sponsor, you are entitled to:

- Inclusion of material in registration package (i.e.,
stickers, postcard or letter-sized mailer)
- Unlimited complementary tickets with RSVP

For marketing materials, we anticipate 50 physical registration packages out of our registration of 130-150 attendees, this also ties into an Alternate Reality Game we will be hosting during the duration of the event. If [SPONSOR_NAME] would like to have materials included in our physical registration package can you let us know ASAP? We'd ideally receive the materials by August 14, 2020 and have limited space (mostly weight!) so want to make sure we plan accordingly.

You can ship anything to:

As always, please let us know if you have any questions,
